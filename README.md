**<h1>🚗 Real-Time-Car-Counter</h1>**

A real-time car detection and tracking project built using YOLOv8, DeepSORT, and OpenCV.
The system detects, tracks, and counts cars as they cross a defined line in traffic footage.

**<h1>🧠 Technologies Used</h1>**

1. Python

2. YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

3. DeepSORT

4. OpenCV

**<h1>⚙️ Features</h1>**

1. Real-time detection using YOLOv8

2. Object tracking using DeepSORT

3. Accurate car counting across a defined line


**<h1>🧩 Installation</h1>**

1. Clone the repository:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/Deepeshgarg12539/Real-Time-Car-Counter.git
cd Real-Time-Car-Counter
</pre>

3. Install dependencies:
<pre>
pip install ultralytics deep-sort-realtime opencv-python
</pre>

**<h1>▶️ Usage</h1>**

-> Open the Jupyter Notebook:<br>
-> jupyter notebook Car_Counter.ipynb<br>
-> Run all the cells to start detection and tracking.<br>
-> Press ESC in the preview window to stop the video.  

**<h1>📊 Output</h1>**

-> Displays detected and tracked vehicles in real time.

-> Shows the total number of vehicles that crossed the red counting line.

**<h1>🧠 Example Output (Frame)</h1>**

See the Working.mp4 for the output and working.
Total Cars Passed: 15
